add option to only search by mandatory classes


by category (concentration)?

when zoom in on a class, show multiple diagrams by distance from current student

default use only mandatory courses in history, toggle for not


enter transcript info (page in tool) use file import, DO NOT ADD TO DATABASE
Use temp data for current student history, compare only to database (not other students in temp data)

Current term needs to be entered. (why?)
Default of semesters in the future is 0, if other than 0 result is 0 up to and including result. 

Add table of cluster data (incl centers?)
Order based on distance function (closest center to target student)

"what if?" section (maybe more useful for future student-faced version)

feedback form

comparison view between methods (same screen for both methods) (side by side?)

first result of machine learning shows cluster center data, not average grade. 
second result uses data from students in cluster, NOT CENTER. 
(add note, distribution of students in cluster may not be the same as cluster center).

testing using a generated dataset with specific numbers of matching students for different scenarios. 

DoT.js templating?

default values: 1 semester, 20% leeway, 

change percent leeway to grade difference?

remove courses that student has already taken
show mandatory courses on top
table view?
side by side view, (table of mandatory courses, 2 of rest) for each method (database, ml)


change history table: headers to be actual semester value. Multiple courses in same semester should be in same cell, not different in same column. 

spacer between mandatory and non-mandatory courses
